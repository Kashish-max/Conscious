mild splendour of the various-vested night!
mother of wildly-working visions! haill
i watch thy gliding, while with watery light
thy weak eye glimmers through a fleecy veil;
and when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud
behind the gather’d blackness lost on high;
and when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud
thy placid lightning o’er the awaken’d sky.
